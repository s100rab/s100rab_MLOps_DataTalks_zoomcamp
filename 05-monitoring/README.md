ðŸš€ Proof of Concept: Real-Time Data Monitoring with Evidently AI and MLOps ðŸš€
I recently completed a proof of concept project that integrates several powerful tools to monitor and evaluate machine learning systems in real-time. This project leverages the capabilities of Evidently AI, Grafana, and PostgreSQL, packaged neatly in Docker containers.



Project Scope and Technology Stack:
- Evidently AI: For generating reports, test suites, and dashboards that evaluate and monitor data and ML models.
- Grafana: For visualizing metrics and creating interactive dashboards.
- PostgreSQL: To store metrics data.
- Docker: To containerize and orchestrate the services for seamless deployment and management.

Challenges Faced:
1. Interpreting Requirements: Initially struggled with understanding the requirements for expanded monitoring and quantile metrics.
2. Integration Complexity: Ensuring seamless integration of Evidently AI reports with Grafana dashboards and PostgreSQL.
3. Dashboard Customization: Customizing and saving dashboard configurations without overwriting existing panels.
4. Data Management: Efficiently managing and querying large datasets to monitor metrics daily.

Solutions and Approach:
- Expanded Monitoring: Using Evidently AIâ€™s `ColumnQuantileMetric` to calculate daily quantile values for fare amounts.
- Separate Configurations: Avoiding overwriting by creating separate database tables and Grafana panels for homework.
- Efficient Queries: Streamlining SQL queries for Grafana dashboards by copying and editing existing queries.
- Automated Workflows: Setting up automated scripts to run daily data monitoring and update dashboards.

Applications in Real-Time Scenarios:
This project showcases the potential for real-time monitoring and evaluation in various ML-powered systems:
- Ride-Sharing Platforms: Monitoring trip fare distributions and identifying anomalies in real-time.
- Financial Systems: Real-time monitoring of transaction amounts to detect fraud or unusual activity.
- Healthcare: Monitoring patient data metrics to ensure consistent and accurate data collection and processing.

Learnings and Next Steps:
Understanding Evidently AI has been a game-changer:
1. Reports: Inline in Jupyter notebooks and exportable to JSON, HTML, etc.
2. Test Suites: Pre-defined presets for common metrics.
3. Dashboards: Customizable panels and integration with external solutions like Prometheus and Grafana.

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
- Evidently AI simplifies the evaluation and monitoring of data and ML models.
- Effective integration of monitoring tools can provide powerful real-time insights.
- Properly organizing and managing configurations and data is crucial for scalable solutions.
